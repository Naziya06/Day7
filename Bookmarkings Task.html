        In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon release. The Times of
        India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but
        can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema
        hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason
        to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it
        all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching
        moments."
